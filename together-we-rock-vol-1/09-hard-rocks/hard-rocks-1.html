        <h3>Project aims</h3>
        <p>This was a project onshore UK for a Platinum Group Metals (PGM) company to help them better delineate the mineral zones and structures on some of their exploration blocks.</p>

        <h3>Exploration/Project challenges</h3>
        <p>The challenge for this project was two-fold: </p>
        <p>1)  Can ADR penetrate through hard igneous rocks, such as basalt and dolerite? </p>
        <p>2)  Can ADR find faults in the subsurface (which would help mineral geologists potentially find sources of mineralisation)?</p>

        <h3>Adrok’s Dielectric results</h3>
        <p>Adrok conducted its usual suite of scans: PScans, WARRs and Stares.  </p>
        <p>The WARR scans, which produced the dielectric logs, should the best results for finding faults.  The premise of Adrok’s fault-picking was that the high dielectric peaks showed wet layers in the ground, which Adrok suspected were water-filled fault zones.   The diagram below shows Adrok’s dielectric curves.  The annotations in the diagram are the client’s notes of where the core samples were crumpled due to wetness.</p>

        <img src="../../images/together-we-rock-vol-1/09-hard-rocks/hard-rocks-2.jpg" />
        <p>The high dielectrics verified by client from core inspection to be broken ground, very broken ground or faulting (caused by moisture) </p>
        <p>The graphs overleaf show Adrok’s ADR spectral curves for energy and frequency responses from the subsurface, with depth; along with the dielectric logs.   The annotations show Adrok’s interpretations of groupings of different rock layers.  This was later corroborated from our client’s drill logs. </p>
        <p>From these results, both Adrok and our Client were satisfied that ADR managed to (a) find faults and (b) propagate through hard rock sequences.</p>
