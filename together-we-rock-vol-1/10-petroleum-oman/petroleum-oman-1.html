        <h2>ADR Case study in Oman Oil & Gas field</h2>

        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
        <p>A unique imaging and mapping solutions based on proprietary technology known as the Atomic Dielectric Resonance (ADR) Scanner developed and provide by our principle Adrok Ltd. ADR is applicable in subsurface earth imaging (Geological) and Medical needs. One of the Oman’s local oil& Gas Operator gave us opportunity to test ADR at his field and judge the result to drilling result. The overall object of the survey was to allow the client to test the applicability of Adrok’s ADR Scanner methods to oil and gas exploration in general.</p>

        <h3>Problem statement:</h3>
        <p>The specific objectives of the job were to test the ability of the ADR Scanner method to usefully predict the lithology and presence of hydrocarbons in the subsurface. The survey involved Adrok training its system by acquiring data at two (2) well locations where the formations of interest have been penetrated by drilling, and the lithology characterised by wireline logging, and comparing ADR interpretations with existing well logs. Client also provided Adrok with oil fluid and rock cutting samples from nearby analogous well locations for material classification training (Spectroscopy or Typecasting).</p>

        <h3>Approach:</h3>
        <p>Adrok were provided two (2) training sites to calibrate the ADR Scanner against; where geology and borehole logs were revealed to Adrok prior to data processing and interpretation. Survey site was a blind test site to Adrok and client – whereby Adrok was not provided with any prior knowledge of subsurface drill logs or geology at this particular location. And the client to compare Adrok’s results against their drill logs and provides Adrok with written evaluation of Adrok’s. Both parties agreed on certain success criteria were client will evaluate the result against.</p>

        <h3>Results:</h3>
        <p>Adrok submitted the result and client has dilled and analyzed the result from both end. ADR technology has manage to meet many agreed criteria, and missed some</p>

        <h3>Conclusions:</h3>
        <p>we concluded from this first test, Adrok’s ADR Scanner is an interesting and low cost method for: <br /><br />
          (a) Identifying subsurface water <br /><br />
          (b) Identifying lithology/well tops, and <br /><br />
          (c) Given further training on local rock and oil conditions (“typecasting”), potentially for hydrocarbons exploration and appraisal “virtual” drilling as a geophysical technique to help oil companies reduce risk of dry holes.</p>
