        <ul>
          <li>Survey Area located in Morocco, North Africa licensed by Caithness Petroleum </li>
          <li>Adrok trained on 3 drilled well locations (for gas & sedimentary rock layer signatures)</li>
          <li>Adrok blind test on 5 locations </li>
          <li>Surface terrain comprised low lying hills and scrubland</li>
          <li>Tortonian sand reservoirs</li>
          <li>Gas horizons were very thin (less than 1m thick). </li>
          <li>Prospect site was 42km offset from training well location</li>
          <li>The results of the Adrok survey were compared to the actual drilling results (Adrok presented results before drilling commenced).  </li>
          <li>Adrok produced Virtual borehole log charts</li>
          <li>No HSE accidents</li>
