        <h3>Background</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The overall objective of the survey is to test the applicability of Adrok’s ADR Scanner for the geological mapping of potential reservoirs and hot sandstone aquifers.</li>
          <li>To identity the Wagina Formation and High Cliff Sandstone</li>
          <li>The geothermal potential of the area appears to be primarily associated with the High Cliff sandstone (~3km depth)</li>
          <li>The formation was encountered in the petroleum exploration well Jingemia-1 and exhibited maximum porosities in excess of 20% and an associated corrected temperature of approximately 123°C.</li>
          <li>VB1 was planned at the collar of the vertical Jingemia-4 in order to intersect the bottom of Jingemia-1, and as a training site for the High Cliff sandstone and the oil bearing Wagina sandstone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Method</h3>

        <img src="../../images/together-we-rock-vol-4/03-australia-greenrock/australia-6.png" />

        <ol>
          <li>Establish relationship using pT1 model
            <ul>
              <li>A cubic regression of depth on temperature (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.9734) was formed</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Use relationship in a predictive regression model where the independent variable, temperature, is predicted from the measured depth of each layer</li>
          <li>Note that the predictive model gives a higher regression relationship (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9995 over 97 degrees of freedom, SIG 0.1%)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Result</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Training based on relatively shallow, high temperature oil reservoirs to depth 600m which may explain the drift in predicted against calibration temperature</li>
          <li>Future improvement would be to train on deeper high temperature targets</li>
        </ol>
